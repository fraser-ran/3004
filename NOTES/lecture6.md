# Lecture 6

## Notes of Interest For A2
- Assignment 2 is released
- Requires USE cases like in A1
- Sequence diagrams are also required $\downarrow$  http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/umlDiagrams.htm
-   Activity or State Diagrams are required(your choice)
- **C++ interfaces**
$\rightarrow$ enought detail in objects that we could potentially create full classes and objects in C++ about them
- should include details about passengers and and sensors (the actors) driving the elevator controller responses through a simple gui
- There should be variability in the allocation strategy
- It is due OCt 12th
- If late by a few minutes, email the prof and tell him why it is late (should be accomadating)
- worth 15% of the course

## Controllers and Behaviours
- **Controller** is a class that is responsible for the behaviour of the system (the elevator)
- **Behaviour** is the response of the system to the environment
- The controller will be responsible for the behaviour of the elevator and updating the system on the state of the elevator
