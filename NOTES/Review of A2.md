# The Parts that were good

## The Use cases (5/5)
- The use cases were good, probably does not need any adjustment

## UML Diagram (10/10)
- Completed all the required material, but was abit rough around the edges
#### Comments from TA:
-   Complete relative to the requirements and use case model
    -   Are all elements from the requirements covered?
        -   Elevators, floors, sensors, buttons …
-   Well formed:
    -   Is UML syntax followed? Cardinalities should be on both sides of the arrows
-   Consistent with the implementation at the class, relationship and interface level
    -   Are all the classes from the header files shown? 
    -   Are all their public interfaces shown?

## Header File (10/10)
-   Code inspection
    -   Consistency with class diagram
    -   Class definition:
        -   member function signatures (name, parameters, return values)
        -   member variables
    -   Well commented and understandable code
    -   NO function implementation, i.e. no .cpp files

## Design explanation (10/10)
-   Well documented design through textual explanation as part of class diagram, sequence diagram or comments in the header files.

# Parts that Need Work

## Sequence Diagrams (6/15)
### Requires:
-   1 Basic use case  
-   5 safety feature use cases  
-   State and activity diagrams are also acceptable and can top up the mark to 15 if the sequence diagrams insufficiently show behaviour.
- check the elvator discription in the assignment pdg online
### **Missing all safety features except for one!** 

## Traceability Matrix (6/10)
-   Requirements to use cases
-   Use cases and/or requirements to design elements.
-   Design elements to header files.
