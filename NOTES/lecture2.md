# Lecture 2
## Notes of interest: 
- read assignment info and do the questions regarding use cases and other things
- go to the textbook and read more about use cases and other things
- FYI Most of the lectures will be focusing on the textbook /source material and as such u can follow along with the textbook, (*should probably download the pdf*)

## Chapter 1 *Intro to Use Cases* 
### 1.1 *What is a Use Case?*
- a use case is like a contract between the user(*stakeholder*) of the system and the program (*system*)

ex: 
    the user asks something for the the program to do and the programmer will carry out the action

- Normally different users will require different actions and different specifications for the program

(*imagine and elevator where some people want the elevator simply to work and another will wonder about the cost of the elevator operating or if it will operate in the event of a power outage*)

**EX:** BUYING stock on the web, and add them to the web portfolio automatically 
- stock buyer is the stakholder and the sytem is the website that the stock is bought from

- Use cases are a form of writing, can be used to stimulate discussion within a team/ group about an upcoming system

- can be described as the interaction between the busines and its: stakeholders, customers, and workers

- often it will involve multiple users (*stakeholders*) that are dependent on each other **EX:** *Insurance claim on a car accident** 

(**READ THE FUCKING TEXT BOOK CHPT 1.1-1.3**)

- Use case designs should cover all or almost all the potential cases
- See example of proper use cases in the textbook int the chapters above in bold
