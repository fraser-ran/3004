## Notes of Interest For A2
- The C++ part of it only means that we have to make the names and signatures of the functions and classes in C++ style in a header file
$\rightarrow$ we should make classes for agents and their interfaces
- Traceability is the ability to trace the requirements back to the design and the design back to the code (more will be shown on the 6th of october)
