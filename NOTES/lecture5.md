- 13 different diagrams the describe 4+1 architectural views

### DIAGRAMS:


**Structural View**
1. class diagram
2. object diagram (is a specific instance of a class diagram *(it has active components and is more than the frameworks)*)
3. Composite Structure Diagram (Package Diagram)

**Behavioural View**
4. Sequence Diagram
5. Communication Diagram
6. State Diagram
7. Activity Diagram
8. Interaction Overview Diagram
9. Timing Diagram

**Implementation View**
10. Component Diagram
11. Composite Structure Diagram

**Environment View**
12. Deployment Diagram

**Use Case View**
13. Use Case Diagram
